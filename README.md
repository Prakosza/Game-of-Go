# Game-of-Go
Project of game of Go in Java
The server with all of game logic and communication part was written by me for last year course on java. The visual part - client was my colleague job and to be fair I didn't put it here. I don't want to publish any line of code that wasn't written by me. I will complete it with my own version.
